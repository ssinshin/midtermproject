                        • Vuetify is an open-source UI component library that allows you to create web apps with stunning visuals without much effort. You can easily add common UI features such as carousels, toolbars, navigation drawers, dialogs, cards, and tables, that already look great to your app. 
                <br>
                <br>
                • Vuetify is a complete UI framework built on top of Vue.js. 
                The goal of the project is to provide developers with the tools they need to build rich and engaging user experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                • Vuetify takes a mobile first approach to design which means your application just works out of the box—whether it’s on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
                <br>
                <br>
                • Vuetify is developed exactly according to Material Design specification with every component meticulously crafted to be modular, responsive, and performant. Customize your application with unique and dynamic Layouts and customize the styles of your components using SASS variables.
                <br>
                <br>
                • Vuetify has a very active development cycle and is patched weekly, responding to community issues and reports at breakneck speed, allowing you to get your hands on bug fixes and enhancements more often.
